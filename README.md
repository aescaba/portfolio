# Amanda Escaba - Personal Portfolio âœ¨
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/17f343c5-a445-4fe9-b44c-583ef4c6e24e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/amandaescaba/deploys)

This is the code for my personal portfolio website. It's meant to be a constant work in progress&mdash;I update work examples, styling, and interactivity to update my portfolio and keep improving my tech stack.

I chose to build this website using Next.js and Tailwind as a means to learn new frameworks. Wireframes were designed using Figma, and it's hosted on Netlify.

Relevant default Next.js README information can be read below.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
