          <p>Coming off the heels of a successful rebranding, the Women&apos;s Business Enterprise Council of Metro NY and Greater DMV (WBEC NY DMV) wanted to update their website to reflect their fresh new look and feel. After my team&apos;s creative director developed the new sitemap and a couple of wireframes, I designed the remaining 90+ pages based off of these concepts and handled the new website build. The result was a website with a modern look, easier navigation, and clearer calls to action.
