        <p>For my final capstone project at Northeastern University, I wanted to incorporate two of my passions: food and Filipino culture. A personal project I had already been thinking of making was documenting family recipes, so my capstone was the perfect way to combine that idea with my interests.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6">Inspired by video games that required the user to interact with objects to progress and facilitate discovery and physical children&apos;s books with interactive components, I designed a website prototype evoking the feel of a loved family cookbook.
