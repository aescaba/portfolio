          <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">Hi, I&apos;m Amanda (she/her)!</span> I&apos;m a proud Filipino American who grew up in the Hudson Valley, New York and
          spent five years studying computer science and interaction design at Northeastern University in Boston.</p>

          <p class="text-xl">I&apos;ve taken on the responsibilities of a <span class="font-semibold text-orange-400">front-end developer and UI/UX designer</span> and I 
          thrive in positions that incorporate skills from both of my disciplines. My favorite thing that design and
          code have in common is the <span class="font-semibold text-amber-400">creative process</span>â€”I love seeing how the decisions made each step of the way come 
          together to support the final product.</p>

          <p class="text-xl">When it comes to my work, I enjoy improving any type of user experience, but I&apos;m most 
          passionate about <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">sharing and preserving culture</span>, <span class="font-semibold text-amber-400">uplifting marginalized voices</span>, and <span class="font-semibold text-orange-400">building community,</span> especially through storytelling.</p>

          <p class="text-xl">I spend my time cooking and baking dishes from my favorite cuisines, ignoring my pile of unread books 
          to buy new ones, singing both parts of the duet by myself, tinkering with my mechanical keyboard, making too many Spotify
          playlists, starting more video games than I tend to finish, and getting distracted by cute dogs in public.</p>
